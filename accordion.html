          WHAT IS SOCIAL WELFARE?
            <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Social welfare is a broad and imprecise term that refers to different things depending on context.
              Strictly speaking, when used with the definite article,
              the term refers to the overall well-being of the entire society, 
             which could be based on such factors as standard of living,
              access to essential social services, quality of the environment and exposure to crime.
             In most general usage however, used without an article,
              it refers to a governmental system designed to assist and improve
               the well-being of those sectors of society most in need. These include those living below the poverty line,
                the elderly/retired, sick/permanently injured, unemployed, and those with new dependents (e.g., young mothers).</p>

           ABOUT SOCIAL WELFARE POLICY
            <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p> In the United States, with its tradition of federalism or shared government,
               social welfare policy is made at local, state, and national levels.
                Policy is made by the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government in the form of laws, 
                executive orders and administrative regulations, and court decisions.
                 A broad view of social welfare policy also recognizes that corporations as well as nonprofit 
                 and for-profit social service agencies make policies that affect the well-being of those they serve
                  and the broader community and therefore have social implications. Many of today’s social welfare policies 
                  address basic human needs such as food, housing, healthcare, and employment, and many of them have roots
                   in the New Deal programs of the 1930s, which were responses to the Great Depression. The civil unrest of the 1960s,
                    the “Great Recession” of 2008,  and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 have also brought about social policy responses.

            ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY
            <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Social security may either be synonymous with welfare, or refer specifically 
              to social insurance programs which provide support only to those who have previously contributed (e.g. most pension systems),
               as opposed to social assistance programs which provide support on the basis of need alone (e.g. most disability benefits).
                The International Labour Organization defines social security as covering support for those in old age,
                 support for the maintenance of children, medical treatment, parental and sick leave, unemployment and disability benefits,
                  and support for sufferers of occupational injury.
              More broadly, welfare may also encompass efforts to provide a basic level of well-being through
              subsidized social services such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, vocational training, 
              and public housing.[10][11] In a welfare state, the state assumes responsibility for the health, education,
           infrastructure and welfare of society, providing a range of social services such as those described.
